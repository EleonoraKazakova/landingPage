# Front End Nanodegree Program

## Weather Journal App with Asynchronous JavaScript

### Description
In this project I wrote most of my code in js/app.js.

I created a navigation menu based on the sections of the page.

While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport should be distinguished from the other sections.

Clicking on a navigation item should scroll to the appropriate section of the page.

A scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
